ingredients
large eggs - 5 pcs
milk - 1/4 cup
salt - 1/2 tsp
pepper - 1/4 tsp
cooking oil - 2 Tbsp
yellow onion - 1 pcs
fresh spinach - 2 cups
grape tomatoes - 150 g
crumbled feta - 60 g

instructions
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Set the eggs aside.
Dice one yellow onion. Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, then add the cooking oil and onion and sauté until the onions are soft and translucent.
Meanwhile, roughly chop the spinach and slice the tomatoes in half.
Add the spinach and tomatoes to the skillet and stir to combine with the onions.
Before the spinach has a chance to cook or wilt, pour in the egg mixture (it's okay if the eggs don't fully cover the vegetables). Top with the crumbled feta.
Cover with lid. Let the frittata continue to cook over medium heat just until the eggs are set (about 6 minutes).
Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
