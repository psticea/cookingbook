ingredients
baby potatoes halved - 1.2 kg
virgin olive oil - 5 Tbsp
lemons - 2 pcs
chicken thighs or breasts - 6 pcs
garlic cloves lightly smashed - 6 pcs
fresh parsley minced - 1 cup
dried oregano - 2 Tbsp
granulated garlic - 1 Tbsp
salt - to taste
pepper - to taste

instructions
Add potatoes to a pan with salted water to heat up, then simmer until they are tenderized, for about 5 min. Preheat the convection oven to 240 Celsius.
For the marinade: In a bowl, toss together the parsley, the juice from one lemon, the crushed garlic, 3 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp of salt and some crushed pepper. Transfer half of the marinade to a large bowl.
Add the granulated garlic, the dried oregano, a bit more salt and 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Add the chicken. Drain the simmering potatoes and add them as well. Toss everything to mix.
When everything is nicely coated, spread in a tray on a cooking sheet. Add the remaining 2 lemon halves in the tray and toss in the oven to roast, until everything is crispy, for 30-40 minutes.
Remove the charred lemon halves and squeeze the juice over the potatoes and chicken. Move the potatoes and the chicken to a bowl, add the remaining marinade and toss to coat everything.
Serve with fresh herbs/salad.
