instructions
Start by marinating the chicken breast with mayo and cracked black pepper. Set a skillet on medium heat and lay down the chicken to cook.
In a large bowl, combine the salad mix, onion, tomatoes, and chickpeas. Season with salt and pepper.
At this moment, flip the chicken. Now, let's move onto the dressing.
In a plastic container, add together the oil, lemon juice, oregano, mint, chili flakes, vinegar, and salt. Close with the lid and vigorously shake to emulsify.
Take the chicken out of the pan and slice up. Add feta and the dressing to the salad and toss to combine.
Serve with the sliced up chicken and enjoy!
