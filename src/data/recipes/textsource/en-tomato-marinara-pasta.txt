ingredients
pasta of your choice - 300 g
large onion diced - 1 1/2 pcs
garlic sliced - 5 cloves
extra virgin olive oil - 3 Tbsp
salt - 1 pinch
cherry tomatoes or pasta sauce - 400 g
shredded parmesan cheese - 60 g
roughly chopped parsley - 1/4 cup
fried chicken breast (optional) - 1 pcs

instructions
Bring a salted pot of water to a boil (5g salt per liter of water) as well as bring a wide saute pan to a medium heat.
Add oil to the wide saute pan. Once it starts to shimmer, add in the chopped onion and garlic.
When the garlic and onion soften a bit, approx 2-3 minutes, add in the cherry tomatoes and top it with the lid. When the water is boiling add in the pasta.
Once the tomatoes are starting to burst, grab a spatula and mash the tomatoes to release the juices. Turn the heat to low, sprinkle in some more salt, and let reduce.
Drain the pasta and add it to the tomato sauce. Pour in 1/4 cup of pasta water and toss. (Add the optional chicken)
Let the sauce reduce and add in the parmesan cheese. Toss in the parsley along with a little more water and crack of pepper.
