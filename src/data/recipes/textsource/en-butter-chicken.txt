ingredients
plain yoghurt full fat - 1/2 cup
lemon juice - 1 Tbsp
tumeric powder - 1 tsp
garam masala - 2 tsp
chilli powder or cayenne pepper powder - 1/2 tsp
ground cumin - 1 tsp
ginger freshly grated - 1 Tbsp
garlic crushed - 2 cloves
chicken thigh fillets cut into bite size pieces - 750 g
butter OR vegetable oil - 2 Tbsp
tomato passata (aka tomato puree) - 1 cup
heavy/thickened cream - 1 cup
sugar - 1 Tbsp
salt - 1 tsp
white rice to serve - as needed
coriander/cilantro (optional) - as needed

instructions
Marinade: Combine the marinade ingredients (yoghurt, lemon juice, tumeric, garam masala, chilli powder, cumin, ginger, garlic) with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).
Cook chicken: Heat the butter (or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don't pour the marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan). Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn't really brown because of the marinade).
Sauce: Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.
Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice.
