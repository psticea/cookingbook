ingredients
jasmine rice - 1 cup
water (cold tap water) - 1 1/4 cups

instructions
Place rice and water in a medium saucepan (one with a tight fitting lid). Bring to rapid simmer with NO LID on medium high.
Turn down to low or medium low so it's simmering gently, then place lid on. Do not lift lid during cook.
Cook 12 minutes or until water is absorbed by rice - tilt pot to check (if lid not glass, then quickly lift lid to check).
Keep the lid on then remove from heat. Stand 10 minutes, fluff with rubber spatula or rice paddle, then serve.

personalNotes
Recipe by Nagi. The key to fluffy jasmine rice is to use less water than usual because it's a softer rice - only 1 1/4 cups for each 1 cup of rice. Most recipes get this wrong and the rice is way too soft/gummy. Rinsing is optional - it barely makes a difference to fluffiness. If you rinse, you need to reduce water by 2 tablespoons to factor in that the rice becomes waterlogged. 1 cup rice = 3 cups cooked = 3 to 4 servings as a side.
