ingredients
beef chuck cut in 2.5 cm cubes - 600 g
cooking salt - 1.5 tsp
black pepper - 1 tsp
extra virgin olive oil - 1 Tbsp
unsalted butter - 30 g
brown onions cut into 1 cm squares - 2 pcs
garlic cloves finely minced - 5 pcs
bell peppers (red and yellow) cut into 2 cm squares - 2 pcs
tomatoes cut into 8 wedges then halved - 2 pcs
Hungarian-style paprika - 4 Tbsp
low-sodium beef stock - 1000 ml
carrots peeled, cut in quarters lengthwise then into 1 cm pieces - 2 pcs
potatoes cut into 1.2 cm cubes - 800 g
finely chopped parsley - 1 Tbsp

instructions
Season the beef with half the salt and pepper.
Heat oil and melt butter in a large heavy-based pot over medium-high heat. Cook onions for about 6 minutes until the edges turn light golden.
Add beef and stir for about 2 minutes until the outside changes from red to brown. It will not brown deeply and that's expected.
Add garlic, bell peppers, and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes; the tomato will mostly break down.
Add paprika and the remaining salt and pepper. Stir for 30 seconds.
Add beef stock, stir, and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to ultra low, cover with a lid, and cook for 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally to ensure the base does not catch.
Stir in potato and carrot. Cover and continue cooking on low heat for another 30 minutes, or until beef is fall-apart tender. If needed, cook an additional 10 minutes at a time.
Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with parsley. Serve as is or with bread for dunking.
