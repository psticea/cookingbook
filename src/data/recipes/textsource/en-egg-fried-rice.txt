instructions
Note for fresh-cooked rice: it's important that it is relatively dry. So long as you spread the rice out on a plate or tray while it's still hot and give it a few minutes to allow some surface moisture to evaporate, you can make excellent fried rice with fresh rice.
Heat 1 Tbsp of oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes.
Press the rice up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 Tbsp of oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Toss with rice to combine.
Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.
Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 Tbsp of oil. Break the egg into the oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss the egg and the rice together.
Add frozen peas and continue to toss and stir until peas are thawed and every grain of rice is separate. Add green onions. Serve immediately.
