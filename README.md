Brainstorm:
I want a website where I can have easy access to all my cooking recipes
I want to host this website on azure.
I want to have a total of 50 recipes.
I want each recipe to be in one specific category.
Each recipe will have a list of ingredients and list of instructions.
The website will have the option to change the language between Romanian and English. Default will be Romanian.
The website will also have the option to adjust that text size between 3 options
There will be a filtering page where based on keywords only recipes that contain all selected keywords will be shown.
Filtering can be done based on meat type. Vegetables. sauce. Cooking type.
Each recipe will also have a picture. The picture will be a square with 1200 by 1200 pixel
The website needs to be display properly on both mobile and PC browser. Should be responsive web design for the UI.
I want an about page.
I want to have five extra recipes about Common cooking like boiling rice mashed potatoes polenta cutting onions. 
I also want a page about cooking basics but you should always stock in your home how to cook by reading first everything and preparing everything.
I want every recipe be exported to a 1 page PDF.
I want metrics about each page access.
