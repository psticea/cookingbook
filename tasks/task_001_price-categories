in the prices pages i want all ingredients to be split in 5 categories:
Proteins 
Dairy 
Fruits and Vegetables
Spices & Seasonings 
Pantry 

So each ingredient used for the prices page will have a new field in the json which is the category.
and based on that the page will have the five categories with each ingredients under its category.

Also odon't show the ingredient id in the page. tihs is just in the json to be internaly used for the matching on each recipe page. 
but it should not be displayed to the user, it is meaningless for him
